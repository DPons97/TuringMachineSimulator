# Non deterministic Turing Machine simulator
Project for theoretical computer science and algorithms course.

Goal: Develop a C program which simulates a non-deterministic turing machine.<br>
Given the machine nodes, the transition set and a sequence of input tapes, it returns 1 if the machine accepts the input, 0 otherwise.
The implementation is required to pass strict performance (with both memory and time constraints) tests.
